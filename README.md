# Linear-Classifiers

Implemented the following linear classifiers:
  1. Logistic regression (logistic.py)
  2. Perceptron (perceptron.py)
  3. SVM (svm.py)
  4. Softmax (softmax.py)

The goal of this assignment is to help you understand the fundamentals of a few classic methods and become familiar with scientific computing tools in Python. You will also get experience in hyperparameter tuning and using proper train/validation/test data splits.

This was an assignment for CS 498: Introduction to Deep Learning (https://slazebni.cs.illinois.edu/spring21/assignment1.html).
